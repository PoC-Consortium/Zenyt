# Commands Reference

Complete reference for all Jantar commands. 

## Hierarchical Command Structure

Jantar uses a hierarchical command structure similar to
git/docker. Commands are organized into groups with subcommands.

## Prefix-based disambiguation

A command can be issued by the shortest unique prefix. So a command
like `quit` can be issued by simply typing `q` as long as there is no
other command starting with `q`. Assume there was a command `query`
(there isn't), then you would have to type `qui` to achieve a command
disambiguation and `que` for the (non existing) `query` command.

This mechanism is here merely for comfort purposes of users who
interactively type in CLI commands. We highly recommend to use
full-length commands in scripts and documentation as best practice.

The addition of new commands may render a previously working shortest
prefix ambiguous thus non-working.

## üìã Command Groups

- `fs` - File system operations
- `net` - Network operations
- `crypto` - Cryptocurrency operations
- `db` - Database operations
- `cfg` - Configuration management
- `sys` - System operations

### db top
Query top addresses by various criteria
```
db top [criterion] [limit] [coin]

# Arguments (positional, in order):
# criterion - What to sort by (default: balance)
# limit     - Number of results (default: 20, max: 100)  
# coin      - Filter by coin type (default: all)

# Available criteria:
# balance   - Top addresses by balance (richlist)

# age-out   - Addresses that sent funds most recently
# oldest    - Oldest addresses by creation date

## Command Shortcuts

Commands support prefix matching - type just enough letters to uniquely identify:

| Full Command | Shortcuts |
|-------------|-----------|
| `help` | `h`, `he`, `hel` |
| `quit` | `q`, `qu`, `qui` |
| `fs ls` | `fs l`, `fs li` |
| `net peers` | `net p`, `net pe` |
| `crypto gen` | `crypto g`, `cry g` |

## Batch Mode

Execute commands without entering interactive mode:

```bash
# Single command
./jantar -e "fs ls"
./jantar --execute "net peers"

# With custom config
./jantar -c alice.cfg -e "sys version"

# Useful for scripts
FILES=$(./jantar -e "fs ls" | grep -c "üìÑ")
```

## Tips

1. **Use `help <command>`** - Get detailed help for any command group
2. **Command History** - Use ‚Üë/‚Üì arrows to navigate previous commands
3. **Prefix Matching** - Type just enough letters to uniquely identify
4. **Batch Processing** - Use `-e` for scripting and automation
5. **Exit Options** - Use `quit`, `exit`, or Ctrl+D to leave
